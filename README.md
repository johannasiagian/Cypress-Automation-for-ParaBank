# Cypress Automation for ParaBank

This is my first project using Cypress for automated testing on the ParaBank demo banking website.

In this project, I practiced:

* Writing Cypress test cases for login and register flows.
* Using fixtures to manage test data (e.g., username and password).
* Applying assertions to verify:
  - Page URL and title.
  - Form input values.
  - Successful login messages.
  - Visibility of elements after actions (e.g., “Welcome” text).

* Capturing screenshots after test execution.

✨ This project helps me build a foundation in E2E testing and understand how Cypress automates web interactions.
